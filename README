# Filesystem

This is a small OCaml module that provides a common interface to a
small set of filesystem operations on Unix (tested on Linux and Mac OS
X) and Windows platforms.

The main improvement in this module over the OCaml standard library is
the use of the unicode Win32 API functions, allowing for "very long
filename" support on Windows, i.e., paths over 250 characters.

Type `make` to build Unix version natively, and `make target=win32` to
build using a cross-compiler on linux for windows. Assumes the Debian
ocaml cross-compiler packages have been installed.
